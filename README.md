# GitHub Pages Photo Test

This is a minimal starter to publish a single photo on GitHub Pages.

## Replace the placeholder image
Put your photo in `/img` and generate three sizes (640, 1280, 2560 px on the long edge), overwriting:
- `img/sample-640.jpg`
- `img/sample-1280.jpg`
- `img/sample-2560.jpg`

Or keep different filenames and edit the `src`/`srcset` in `index.html`.

## Local preview
Just open `index.html` in a browser; itâ€™s fully static.
